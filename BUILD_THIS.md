# BUILD THIS TONIGHT

## The MVP: Photo → Price → Listing

A simple web app that:
1. Takes a photo of clothing
2. Removes background automatically
3. Reverse image searches for similar items
4. Shows price range across platforms
5. Generates listing description
6. Suggests which platform to use

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Simple HTML/JS (or React if feeling fancy)
- Background removal: remove.bg API or rembg library
- Image search: Google Lens API or SerpApi
- Price data: Web scraping or manual for MVP

## Tonight's Goal
Get steps 1-2 working. Photo upload → clean image out.

## Command to start:
```bash
claude "Build a simple web app that takes a photo upload, removes the background using the rembg Python library, and displays the result. Make it clean and minimal. Save to /Users/dianagentenv/clawd/projects/reselling-app/app/"
```

DO IT.
