## Gap Analysis (What We Could Do Better)

1. **Chinese platform support** (小红书) - NOBODY does this well
2. **"Don't sell at a loss" floor** - Most tools don't track what you paid
3. **Mobile-first UX** - Most are desktop-focused
4. **Price intelligence** - Real-time comp analysis before listing
5. **Inventory aging alerts** - "This has been listed 30 days, drop price?"

## Notes
- Market is getting crowded
- Differentiation needed
- 小红书 integration could be our moat
